instruction: |
  Write a Bash script that reads a number from a file called `input.txt`
  and writes `even` if the number is even, or `odd` if the number is odd,
  into a file called `output.txt`.

  Requirements:
  - The input will always be a single non-negative integer (0â€“9999).
  - The output must be exactly `even` or `odd` (lowercase, no extra spaces, no newline at the end).
  - Example: if `input.txt` contains `7`, then `output.txt` must contain `odd`.
